Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's <span style='background-color: rgb(204, 232, 204);'>mouth is closed</span>, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species family. Crocodiles have <strong style='color: rgb(102, 185, 102);'>more webbing</strong> on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators.

There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form krokodeilos found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, krokodilos and krokodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodalus used by the ancient Romans. It is ascribed to Herodotus, and supposedly describes the <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 204, 204);">basking habits</span> of the Egyptian crocodile. Crocodylidae is cladistically defined as a crown group composed of the last common ancestor of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), the Dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), and all of its descendants. Crocodylinae contains 13-14 living species, as well as 6 extinct species. Osteolaeminae was named by Christopher Brochu in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae.</p>",4

The light receptors in crocodilians' eyes include cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colours. Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, similar to those of domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect the eyes during daylight. On the rear wall of the eye is a <strong style='color: rgb(0, 71, 178);'>tapetum lucidum</strong>, which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane (sometimes called a 'third eye-lid') that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lids are open.

To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear <span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);'>one in front of the other</span> instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.

While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi. There are numerous debates in the systematics within the group.
